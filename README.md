Using data from NASDAQ, this web application is designed to make predictions about the stock market in a user-defined interval. This will help investors make better, forward-thinking decisons using trends from past, yet similar situations. The only information the user needs to input is the ticker symbol (for example, AAPL for Apple Inc.) and the date (starting from January 1, 2008).
